Welcome to the 2023-2024 UCL ML MSc Supervised Learning module's coursework.

In this repository you will find my submission to both coursework and their corresponding feedback.

I upload our work to help future students through some of the hardest exercises and to verify your work based on our feedback. Please do not straight up copy our code.

Warning: If you are going to straight up copy I highly reccommend writing everything with your own words and changing the logic of the code as much as you can. UCL may keep past year submissions for anti-plagiarism purposes only.

Hope this helps :)
